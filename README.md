# Rainforest QA Challenge Solution

This is a Node.js solution to the Rainforest QA challenge.

You can run `npm run build` to regenerate the index, or you can use the one stored in this repo.

The last output of the script is in `output.txt`, and if you want to regenerate the output just run `node index` and watch the file regenerate!
